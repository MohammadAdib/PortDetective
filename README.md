# Port Detective

Port Detective is a network port scanning tool designed to detect open ports on hosts on the local network. The port scanning algorithm is capable of scanning all 65535 ports in under a minute or two.

This application also comes with a Port Encyclopedia, enabling the user to quickly look up what a certain port's function is. A local database is stored on the phone for defining ports, however there is also an option to look it up online for the most recent information.
